```

### fix issue with directory listing names

Minio has changed in the last months to be more picky about path names so we
now enure that we don't create path prefixes with a // suffix.


## 0.3.5

#### Add support for skipping bucket existst/policy check on start up
https://github.com/py-pa/django-minio-storage/commit/7086f125ed74b157240bae10c589ce785ca93bbf

Added settings MINIO_STORAGE_ASSUME_MEDIA_BUCKET_EXISTS and
MINIO_STORAGE_ASSUME_STATIC_BUCKET_EXISTS

## 0.3.4

#### • fixed resource leak where one extra file was opened per file and never closed
https://github.com/py-pa/django-minio-storage/commit/1532e34c7dcecbc2cf3ca0805d6fbf42b57c25ba
  
There leaked file descriptors were only freed by the gargabe collector before
this fix so if you have farily tight loop that does something to a lot of files
while not generating a lot of garbage to trigger the gc.


## 0.3.3

#### • reworked management commands and added tests.

```
$ python manage.py minio
